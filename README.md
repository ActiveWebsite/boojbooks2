# Booj Reading List
*Beware of the person of one book. -- Thomas Aquinas*
## Assignment
A junior programmer has been tasked with creating a reading list app with basic CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using the Laravel framework. They are new to the Laravel framework and have made numerous mistakes in the process. **Please review their code and point out any issues you see. You do not have to fix their code, just go into detail about what needs to be fixed.** You can review using comments in the code or an external document, whichever you prefer.

Additionally, the programmer has not written any tests for their code! **Please write some tests for this project, covering the backend and frontend.**
